# sandboxduino

This project contains code samples and libraries tested on Arduino UNO R3. You will find code samples for:

SainSmart LCD keypad shield

Dual Stepper Motor driver shield

other basic experiments

SainSmart Stepper Motor Shield (Adafruit shield clone)

Other tips and tricks that I've learned.

I needed to update and trace some problems with those libraries, so hope you will find this useful.
